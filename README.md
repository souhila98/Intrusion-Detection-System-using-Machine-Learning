# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning
# Problem description 
Intrusion detection using machine learning is a field that harnesses algorithms and techniques to automatically identify and classify malicious or anomalous activities within computer networks or systems. By analyzing network traffic patterns and other relevant data, machine learning approaches have the potential to detect and respond to security threats effectively.

The primary focus of this project is to implement a comprehensive set of robust predictive models, specifically classifiers, that have the ability to distinguish between "bad connections" associated with intrusions or attacks and "good" connections representing normal network behavior. By deploying these predictive models, the system will contribute to enhancing the overall security of computer networks and systems by providing proactive identification of malicious activities.

The project involves various stages, including EDA, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Firstly, a deep analysis of the dataset is conducted. Next, relevant features are extracted from the data.

The core of the project lies in training a robust set of predictive models, leveraging machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines,.... These models will be trained on the labeled dataset to learn the underlying patterns and characteristics associated with malicious or anomalous activities. Through this training process, the models will acquire the ability to accurately distinguish between normal and potentially threatening network connections.

To ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the developed models, an evaluation will be conducted using appropriate performance metrics. This evaluation will assess the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant measures to determine their capability in detecting and classifying security threats.

# Dataset 
The KDD Intrusion Detection Dataset, also known as the KDDCup'99 dataset, is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of intrusion detection and network security. It was created as part of the Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition held in 1999. The dataset was designed to simulate a real-world network environment and contains a representative sample of network traffic data.

The KDD dataset is derived from a large amount of raw network data collected from a military network simulation environment. It consists of a set of preprocessed network connection records, where each record represents a specific network connection or activity. The dataset aims to capture a variety of normal and attack-related activities, allowing researchers to develop and evaluate intrusion detection systems.

The dataset contains a total of five million connection records, which are classified into different types of network attacks or normal activities. The attacks are categorized into four main classes: Denial of Service (DoS), User to Root (U2R), Remote to Local (R2L), and Probing. The normal activities represent legitimate network connections.

Each connection record in the dataset is described by 41 features, including attributes related to protocol type, service type, source and destination addresses, duration of the connection, number of failed login attempts, and various statistical measures calculated from the network traffic. These features provide valuable information for analyzing and detecting network intrusions.
