# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning
# Problem description 
Intrusion detection using machine learning is a field that harnesses algorithms and techniques to automatically identify and classify malicious or anomalous activities within computer networks or systems. By analyzing network traffic patterns and other relevant data, machine learning approaches have the potential to detect and respond to security threats effectively.

The primary focus of this project is to implement a comprehensive set of robust predictive models, specifically classifiers, that have the ability to distinguish between "bad connections" associated with intrusions or attacks and "good" connections representing normal network behavior. By deploying these predictive models, the system will contribute to enhancing the overall security of computer networks and systems by providing proactive identification of malicious activities.

The project involves various stages, including EDA, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Firstly, a deep analysis of the dataset is conducted. Next, relevant features are extracted from the data.

The core of the project lies in training a robust set of predictive models, leveraging machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines,.... These models will be trained on the labeled dataset to learn the underlying patterns and characteristics associated with malicious or anomalous activities. Through this training process, the models will acquire the ability to accurately distinguish between normal and potentially threatening network connections.

To ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the developed models, thorough evaluation will be conducted using appropriate performance metrics. This evaluation will assess the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant measures to determine their capability in detecting and classifying security threats.
